## Feather Development is in Apache Arrow

Feather development lives on in [Apache
Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow). The `arrow` R package includes [a much
faster implementation of
Feather](http://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/08/08/r-package-on-cran/),
i.e. `arrow::read_feather`. The Python package `feather` is now a wrapper
around `pyarrow.feather`.
