# Tries to find Flatbuffers headers and libraries.
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#  find_package(Flatbuffers)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  Flatbuffers_HOME -
#   When set, this path is inspected instead of standard library locations as
#   the root of the Flatbuffers installation.  The environment variable
#   FLATBUFFERS_HOME overrides this veriable.
#
# This module defines
#  FLATBUFFERS_INCLUDE_DIR, directory containing headers
#  FLATBUFFERS_LIBS, directory containing flatbuffers libraries
#  FLATBUFFERS_STATIC_LIB, path to libflatbuffers.a
#  FLATBUFFERS_FOUND, whether flatbuffers has been found
